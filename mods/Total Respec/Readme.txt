This mod adds four potions to the inventory of the general items merchant. All of them lower stats and give back stat points.
The official Respec Potion mod is included too, to allow resetting of skillpoints.

The Lesser Stat Reset Elixer reduces all stats by 1 and grants 4 stat points.
The Stat Reset Elixer reduces all stats by 2 and grants 8 stat points.
The Greater Stat Reset Elixer reduces all stats by 5 and grants 20 stat points.
The Legendary Stat Reset Elixer reduces all stats by 10 and grants 40 stat points.


If your stats go into the negatives, all your equipment will be returned to your inventory.
I don't know what happens when you save you character with negative stats, but I don't recommend trying it!


Thanks go to:
-Runic/Tiamat for the idea of respeccing, and for the skill respec potion. And for the game of course!
-CoolasaCucumber and Sunniex of the 'Easy Respec' mod for giving me an idea of how to reduce stat points.
-Nanenj for showing how to add items to the general vendor without overriding it.


Install the usual way, by placing this folder in the %appdata%\runic games\torchlight\mods folder.


CHANGELOG

Version 1.0:
  Initial release
  
Version 1.1:
  Changed the way the potions are added to the 'General Items' vendor, so it doesn't conflict with other mods.
